# clusterbot-setup-script
A script that automatically sets up development environment for ceph-dashboard use

# How to Use:

Download the Cluster Bot file given to you when your cluster is created.

Make sure you have:
1. Password of your cluster bot (found on slack)
2. Server for your cluster bot (found within the downloadable file from slack)
3. Path to where you downloaded the cluster bot file

After running the script, a password should be printed at the bottom of your terminal. That is your ceph-dashboard password.
